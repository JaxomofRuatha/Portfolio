          My experience in data analysis officially started in college. As a psychology major with an emphasis in statistics, I frequently analyzed data and summarized both quantitative and qualitative results of my research studies. The ability to gain insight from raw data and refine it into an actionable report has served me well, and I have used it when possible to bring value to my work roles as well as create interesting personal projects. In my position in an assisted living environment, I refined the reporting process to care teams to make use of data collected daily for each client using analysis in Excel. The deeper conclusions reached by structured analysis of the logging resulted in changes to individual service plans and improvement of resident living conditions. As an insurance sales agent, I determined areas of potential improvement within my workflow by recording information from metrics and interaction content, and prioritized the most successful time spent. By doing this, I was able to cut my handle time to a third of where I started while increasing my sales by more than double to achieve top 20 personal sales results company wide. In my role as a software analyst with Best Buy, I have volunteered to take part in projects using logging and casing data, and assisted in finding areas of greatest opportunity to redirect call volume.

          In the last two years, I have introduced SQL into my analysis, and have been amazed with the versatility of the query language. I have used it in a few projects, the largest of which being creating rankings of individuals based on tournament data of a video game from official competitions. Currently I am working on analyzing data from several datasets on Kaggle and experimenting with use of Python and D3 (a JavaScript library), as well as comparing the features of each to SQL and SAS. For the purposes of SAS specifically, my experience thus far has been working through some functionality of the program to compare its capabilities with those of base MySQL. I'm extremely excited by the additional options and power it provides, and will be using it frequently going forward in conjunction with data visualization tools.
